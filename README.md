# EduMorph-Adaptive-Learning-Path-Generator-Using-Cognitive-Analysis
EduMorph is an AI-powered adaptive learning platform designed to enhance the e-learning experience by personalizing content delivery based on students' cognitive preferences and interaction patterns. It dynamically generates learning paths and content formats to suit individual learning styles.

## üß† Problem
Most students have different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, etc.), but current e-learning platforms provide a one-size-fits-all experience. Many students struggle to keep up or lose motivation because the content delivery isn't aligned with how they learn best.

## üí° Solution
EduMorph uses artificial intelligence to analyze student interaction data, performance, and cognitive preferences to:
- **Detect Learning Styles**: Analyze behavior and preferences, such as scroll speed, pauses, replays, and quiz responses.
- **Generate Adaptive Content**: Transform static content into various formats (e.g., text to video snippets, mind maps).
- **Personalize Learning Paths**: Adjust the sequence and difficulty of modules based on mastery and engagement levels.

## üîß Key Features
### Learning Style Detection
- Behavioral analysis: Scroll speed, pauses, replays, etc.
- Mini-assessments to detect preferences (textual, visual, or auditory).
### Adaptive Content Engine
- Converts static content into multiple formats:
  - Text ‚Üí Video snippets
  - Text ‚Üí Mind maps
  - Text ‚Üí Audio narration (using OpenAI APIs)
### Pace & Path Customization
- Reorders modules dynamically based on:
  - Student's mastery level
  - Engagement metrics
### Microfeedback Loop
- Small quizzes after every module to:
  - Adjust difficulty
  - Suggest revisions or alternative formats

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
### Frontend
- Framework: **React / Next.js**
### Backend
